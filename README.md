# Mask detection using YOLOv4
This repository contains the 4 custom files needed. (i.e. yolov4-custom.cfg, obj.data, obj.names and process.py) except obj.zip(labeled images).

I hade uploaded my colab notebook also where I had created a #custom object detector using Yolo-v4# to detect wether person is wearing a mask or not. I had imported darnet in my project from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/.

Here I had used only two labels:
1.) Mask
2.) Without Mask

The obj.zip file contains 1510 images along with their YOLO labeled text files. I have labeled around 1350 of these and downloaded 149 labeled images from roboflow. I have given the links for my dataset sources at the bottom. You can download it from my drive -

This dataset has mostly close-up images (around 1300) and very few long-shot images (around 200).
